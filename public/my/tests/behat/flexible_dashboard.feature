Feature: Arrange dashboard blocks in a responsive grid
  In order to make my dashboard useful at different sizes
  As a user
  I need to move, resize, add and remove dashboard blocks

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                |
      | student1 | Student   | 1        | student1@example.com |
    And I log in as "student1"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Move, resize, add and remove blocks with accessible controls
    When I turn editing mode on
    Then "Open block drawer" "button" should not exist
    And I click on "Move Course overview block" "button" in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I click on "Down" "button" in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I click on "Move Course overview block" "button" in the "Course overview" "block"
    Then I should see "Item moved to row"
    When I click on "Resize block" "button" in the "Course overview" "block"
    Then "Up" "button" should exist in the "Course overview" "block"
    And the resize directional controls are centred on the active resize handle
    And I press the down key
    And I press the enter key
    Then I should see "Item resized to"
    When I click on "Add a block at the start of the dashboard" "button"
    And I click on "Online users" "button" in the "Add a block" "dialogue"
    Then "Online users" "block" should exist
    When I click on "Delete Online users block" "button" in the "Online users" "block"
    And I click on "Confirm" "button" in the "Remove block" "dialogue"
    Then "Online users" "block" should not exist

  @javascript
  Scenario: Drag the dedicated handles to move and resize a block
    When I turn editing mode on
    And I drag ".core-my-dashboard-tile[data-block='myoverview'] .core-my-dashboard-handle--move" "css_element" and I drop it in ".core-my-dashboard-tile[data-block='myoverview'] .core-my-dashboard-tile__content" "css_element"
    Then I should see "Item moved to row"
    When I hover ".core-my-dashboard-tile[data-block='myoverview'] .core-my-dashboard-handle--resize" "css_element"
    And I drag ".core-my-dashboard-tile[data-block='myoverview'] .core-my-dashboard-handle--resize" "css_element" and I drop it in ".core-my-dashboard-tile[data-block='myoverview'] .core-my-dashboard-tile__content" "css_element"
    Then I should see "Item resized to"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Move a block into an adjacent free column
    When I turn editing mode on
    And I change viewport size to "2600x1000"
    Then "[data-columns='6']" "css_element" should exist
    And dragging the "recentlyaccesseditems" dashboard block into an adjacent free column persists

  @javascript
  Scenario: Resize follows the pointer and previews its snap target
    When I turn editing mode on
    And I change viewport size to "2600x1000"
    Then "[data-columns='6']" "css_element" should exist
    And keyboard activation shows resize directional controls
    And the mouse resize preview follows the pointer before snapping to a grid cell

  @javascript
  Scenario: Bumped blocks ease into their new grid position
    When I turn editing mode on
    And I change viewport size to "2600x1000"
    Then "[data-columns='6']" "css_element" should exist
    And blocks bumped by a pointer resize ease into their new grid position

  @javascript
  Scenario: Growing a block into a row neighbour pushes it sideways, not to the row start
    When I turn editing mode on
    And I change viewport size to "2600x1000"
    Then "[data-columns='6']" "css_element" should exist
    And resizing the Course overview block into its row neighbour pushes it right

  @javascript
  Scenario: Growing a block into a column neighbour pushes it downwards, not to the grid start
    When I turn editing mode on
    And I change viewport size to "2600x1000"
    Then "[data-columns='6']" "css_element" should exist
    And resizing the Calendar block into its column neighbour pushes it down

  @javascript
  Scenario: Calendar renders compactly in its narrow default column
    When I turn editing mode on
    And I change viewport size to "2600x1000"
    Then "[data-columns='6']" "css_element" should exist
    And the Calendar block renders compact day cells

  @javascript
  Scenario: Reflow the grid from six columns down to one
    When I turn editing mode on
    And I change viewport size to "2600x1000"
    Then "[data-columns='6']" "css_element" should exist
    When I change viewport size to "900x1000"
    Then "[data-columns='2']" "css_element" should exist
    When I change viewport size to "600x900"
    Then "[data-columns='1']" "css_element" should exist

  @javascript
  Scenario: A user without the site-default capability sees no scope switch CTA
    When I turn editing mode on
    Then I should see "Editing your dashboard"
    And "Switch to editing the default dashboard for all users" "link" should not exist
    When I turn editing mode off
    Then I should not see "Editing your dashboard"

  @javascript
  Scenario: The block actions menu is capped at Configure, Permissions and Check permissions
    Given I log out
    And I log in as "admin"
    When I turn editing mode on
    And I click on "More actions for Course overview" "button" in the "Course overview" "block"
    # Course overview has no fields of its own to edit - with the where-this-block-appears
    # fields hidden on the dashboard, Configure would otherwise open an empty modal.
    Then I should not see "Configure Course overview block" in the ".core-my-dashboard-block-actions__menu" "css_element"
    And I should see "Manage permissions" in the ".core-my-dashboard-block-actions__menu" "css_element"
    And I should see "Check permissions" in the ".core-my-dashboard-block-actions__menu" "css_element"
    And I should not see "Move Course overview block" in the ".core-my-dashboard-block-actions__menu" "css_element"
    And I should not see "Delete Course overview block" in the ".core-my-dashboard-block-actions__menu" "css_element"
    And "Hide Course overview block" "button" should not exist
    And the block actions menu sits to the right of the delete control
    # A block with fields of its own, like Text, still offers Configure.
    When I click on "Add a block at the start of the dashboard" "button"
    And I click on "Text" "button" in the "Add a block" "dialogue"
    And I click on ".core-my-dashboard-block-actions__trigger" "css_element" in the ".core-my-dashboard-tile[data-block='html']" "css_element"
    Then I should see "Configure (new text block) block" in the ".core-my-dashboard-block-actions__menu" "css_element"

  @javascript
  Scenario: An administrator can switch between their own dashboard and the site default while editing
    Given I log out
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I visit "/my/index.php"
    When I turn editing mode on
    Then I should see "Editing your dashboard"
    And I click on "Switch to editing the default dashboard for all users" "link"
    Then I should see "Editing the default dashboard for all users"
    And I should see "Switch to editing your dashboard"
    When I click on "Switch to editing your dashboard" "link"
    Then I should see "Editing your dashboard"
